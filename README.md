### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm a Front-End Developer passionate about User Interface and User Experience.
- ðŸŒ± Currently developing BlueShip for [iOS] (https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/blueship/id1573998645) and [Android] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blueship.mobile).
- ðŸ¥ž I thought JavaScript was the way to go until I learned more about TypeScript. Boom! Fell in love with it. 
- âš¡ Not tech-related, but you can find me on [YouTube] (https://youtu.be/yyyYsj0ovtY) playing my guitar or at the closest rock-climbing gym.
